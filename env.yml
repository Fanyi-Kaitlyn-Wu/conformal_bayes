# Note:
# - Originally tested on Python 3.7.5; for reproducibility, exact versions used were jax (0.2.13) and jaxlib (0.1.66).
# - For Python versions >=3.9, dependencies may resolve to newer versions, but compatibility should be verified.
# - We recommend creating a new virtualenv/conda environment before installing the package, and using the latest version of setuptools or pip.
# - Pystan may need to be installed separately via pip.
# - For GPU support with JAX, use pip:
#   pip install --upgrade jax jaxlib==0.1.66+cuda111 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
